- Fix case-sensitivity for HAC on Windows
- Check:
  Load 6 libraries
  Free the first five
  Free the last one
  Load a new one - is alib_id = 0?
  Need plenty of testing with the code pages thing - unloading etc.
- Fix nagt so it can't produce illegally large segments. Will do this when .packed is added.
- change realloc u, s to reperm.
- Come to think of it, allocating RO memory is never useful. The whole alloc instruction
  should be changed to alloc dest, size; just like realloc.
- common library for image file manipulations.
- Update documentation.
- Alter metastack to allow cleaner resizing and a way around exception bug in LAC.
- Eliminate perror & stderr code
- Agents (Mental Note: network byte order!)
- Windows Threads
- packed data in NAGT
- Complete CFD and STRFD call set.
- Debugging images without gdb and hard work
- Allow DL memory to be added anywhere, not just on top.
- Improve memory allocation (i.e. allow large blocks.)
- Use a better memory paradigm than paging, for small blocks.
- LAC improvements: 
  + it's easy to use more than registers for variables; just push
    a static. Not that 32 variables does you much good.
  + Rewrite as an optimizing compiler. (I bags this one: JSK)
- HAC: Profile & Optimize.
	Flat Hash?
- NAGT: Symbol Hash.
- other platforms...?
- swapendian
- FIX UGLY BUGS IN IMAGE DEF'N:
	- messagedesc.size != size of payload: CODE, DATA
	- reloc offsets based on bcode_op_packed not bcode_op
	  (i.e. alignment differences will cause hack alerts)
	- library for image handling?
