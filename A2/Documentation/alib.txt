IT'S FINALLY HERE! DYNAMICALLY LINKED ARGANTE LIBRARIES - YES!

You can:

load (or LD_PRELOAD, even) libraries on the console:
$image1:library1:library2:library3:...

Load and unload libraries from A2 code with ALIB_* functions
(images must be stored under /lib and HAC must allow 'load' on them)

Yes, it even works in LACRETNI!

Issues:
- This is not usable with native code. If you are using cify
  please turn this feature off with NO_ALIB.
- There is a small performance penalty involved in checking
  when to change pages. If you don't need to load code libraries,
  you can turn it off with NO_CODE_PAGES.
- It currently requires free memory at the 'top' of address
  space for the library's data blocks and contiguous space for
  the code pages.
  It takes an effort, but if the address space is sufficiently
  fragmented this may be unavailable and loading will fail.
