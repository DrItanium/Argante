A2-prealpha 'Rose' adds Native-Code (well, C source code anyway) compilation
abilities. The required app is under compiler, it's called cify.

./cify image.img hac.hac
will dump to standard out, C source code equivalent to the image and the HAC.

Compile it and link against system.a in the kernel dir and modload.a in the
modules directory. You now have a standalone binary containing image.img and
hac.hac.

Or just try 'make image.native'

BTW: If you're using dynamic, you should feed the binary the names of the
modules to load on the command line.

******************* Build0.005 addenum:
If you're NOT using dynamic, it would be wise to compile your kernel with
NO_ALIB. This will leave out the syscall module for run-time linking, and
the stubs in the kernel that let compilation succeed if you don't.
Run-time linking doesn't work too well with native code, so all leaving it
in does is waste space :)
