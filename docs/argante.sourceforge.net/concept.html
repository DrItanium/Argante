This is free-of-charge, open-source LGPL project.

Argante is a fully virtual environment for running applications on Unix
systems. This makes many people think about Java and its sandbox for example,
although the technical reasons Argante is based on were totally different.

For one thing, Argante is a complete operating system. It has its own
implementation of processes, inter-process communication, filesystem,
access control... All built on the top of basic real OS low-level
implementation, but with own control mechanisms, own semantics and so on.
Why all this? I will try to explain:

The standard architecture of operating systems and hardware (e.g processors)
falls flat when it comes to security and stability of the software.
To be short: it lacks low lewel support for general access control, error
handling (primitive techniques existing in, say, the 80386 series are not
enough), and the architecture of stack or data segment usage is based on
some mistaken assumptions.

Trying to fix these errors at a higher level is generally risky and
unsuccessful. The authors of Java have created a miserably slow and, as a
matter of fact, not always secure / portable solution with very limited
application range; moreover, they were unable to force software authors to use
safe, verified architecture models, e.g. OSI, limited trust and interaction
architecture which presumes that only the two closest data processing layers
work together and the code itself is divided into functional segments.
Programs written in C using the model "listener -> fork() -> client handling"
are still easier to implement and less prone to failure.
In this way the list of these and other remarks concerning the popular
hardware and software architecture model came into being. Its essence can
be best summed up in the motto at the beginning of this document:

"[We] use bad software and bad machines for the wrong things."
                                            -- R.W. Hamming

Except complaints I had many ideas which in my opinion should be, and,
with minimal cost could be, taken into account in implementations at both
these levels: hardware and software.

At a certain point I had a difficult decision to make: I could modify
existing implementations, trying to patch them with temporary solutions,
risking that most of these ideas will never be realized, and being aware
that the project will become a series of compromises, among which the sense
of its realisation will be lost :) I could as well do another thing:
sit and rewrite everything from scratch. Forgetting about compatibility,
conventions, trying to create a solution which will defend itself, or one
nobody will notice :) In this way the idea of Argante started, having at
its basis the four principal proposals:

- security and stability
- functionality
- efficiency
- simplicity

Argante is supposed to be a system with no compromises. That is why always
when in the traditional system we would face choice "security or
functionality", instead of choosing one variant we concluded the choice
itself is bad and created its outline from scratch or changed the model in
order to reconcile our requirements with expectations.

Why, then, is it an "embedded" system? There are many reasons for that. For
one thing, an embedded implementation does not enforce OS change, makes
first attempts and projects easy, providing integration with existing
solutions on native Unix platforms. In this way Argante introduces an
additional abstraction and protection layer, acting as a completely independent
hardware architecture, and without enforcing serious changes. Its being
written in C assures efficiency and portability.

Moreover, an implementation which can use existing system drivers, devices,
system functions, becomes a much simpler task and permits programmers to
concentrate on the substance instead of implementation details (bootloader,
drivers etc.).

Naturally, when speaking of stability and security of an embedded system
I mean its implementing access control systems independent from the native
platform, its own multi-process model: all these solutions are safe and
independent of the real system. That's why Argante will be a safe solution
on almost any Unix (or maybe even Windows?;) provided that elementary
security of the native platform will be ensured; in the simplest variant,
all network services should be removed (hybrid solutions, described with
rIPC and network, constitue a separate case).

In order to realize the four enumerated proposals, I have created general
guidelines for the system. They were as follows:

- the core of the system will be a microkernel providing base functionality;
  all input/output operations will be performed using loadable modules, easy
  to implement by the user and added/removed while the system is running;
  the modules can also contain other, necessary functions, for example
  providing advanced operations on text strings and similar procedures,

- the system will provide _any_ functionality permitting software creation,
  starting from a database server to a graphics application without any
  need to change system code, and at the same time ensuring the highest
  security level,

- the system will have its own, low-level, hardware platform independent
  virtual machine language; this language will be simple and efficient
  enough to ensure speed and effectivity, and at the same time it will
  ensure full separation from the real system and will not allow native
  code execution,

- system management will be fully separated from processes run in the
  virtual system; user-space and kernel-space will also be fully separated,
  without any possibility of interference into kernel-space from the level
  of user-space,

- every process run in the system will dispose of its own, private address
  space, separate stack segment which will not be directly addressed
  (used only by jump/return functions); the same applies to the code segment,
  which will not be directly addressable. Only the code segment will be
  executable,

- a process will be allowed to allocate memory blocks, separately mapped
  to its own adressing space (with the possibility of write protection);
  the system will control all attempts of going beyond the allocated
  block (buffer),

- the system will support low-level exception handling and will allow the
  program to handle them (LLX - low-level exceptions),

- the system will have its own, secure and resource-saving implementation
  of multitasking and its own, static process model (SMTA) with assigned
  fixed privilege lists; multi-user applications will also be supported
  by the possibility of defining a subgroup identifier in a given privilege
  domain,

- a new philosophy of privilege granting and dropping, without risks inherent
  in the Unix implementation,

- from its very beginning the system will support secure solutions (e.g.
  unbounded strings instead of null-terminated ones, etc.),

- the system will provide hierarchical, centralized and universal
  implementation of Hierarchical Access Control (HAC), permitting
  defining privileges with arbitrary detail level; additionally, the system
  will enforce the "switch" architecture, forcing the programmer to define
  which privileges are necessary in order to perform a given task without
  permitting having any others,

- the system will strongly support the OSI architecture, including
  distributed architecture, providing advanced mechanisms of inter-process
  communication IPC (a specific solution, different from the one existing
  in Unix) and rIPC (remote IPC session distribution among equivalent
  processes, communication between tasks on different computers transparent
  for user-space); rIPC will also support transparent cluster architecture

- the system will have its own implementation of a virtual filesystem,
  accessible from the level of a real filesystem, and at thse same time
  permitting establishing arbitrary inner structure and full access control
  compatible with HAC

- changing any functionality will be possible without stopping the system

Argante favours creating hybrid solutions, for example applications
of the real systems coordinated / protected by Argante code. This will
enable one to transparently create reduntant, heterogenic clusters with
morphing possibilities, self-assigning new objects in existing hierarchy
and full redundance as well as load balancing without _any_ programming
costs. It doesn't matter whether the system will work on one machine or a
hundred, with redundance and load balancing - the rIPC philosophy solves
distributed systems problems in a way transparent for applications.

What else? Well, Argante could act not only as a cluster development platform,
but, in fact, it makes complex development really easy and clean. For
example, to design distributed, fault-tolerant virtual router, you could
use only several thousands lines of readable and elegant code, which can
be maintained for years with no risk.

Well, but that's not all. To prove AOS isn't only the "distributed networking
software", we decided to develop svgalib connectivity module to demonstrate
how fast and effective - especially when compared eg to Java - Argante can
be. Enjoy.

I know it sounds like a wish list, but I'm writing these words having
implemented most of the system's code and, to my surprise, I can
(no-so-modestly) say that I have suceeded in attaining these aims.
What have I got?

- security and stability:

  - practically speaking, impossibility of taking control over an application
    in the system (stack, data segment and buffer control, the approach of
    passing parameters to syscalls without depending on C conventions, like
    null-term); because of a quite limited number of RSIS opcodes, privilege
    control is a trivial matter,

  - even if it were possible, no possibility of getting privileges enabling
    one to breach the security of the rest of the virtual system
    (separation of management from the virtual system, from kernel-space),

  - even if it were possible, lack of any possibility of influencing real
    system (separate implementation of multitasking, not using the
    implementation of the real system),

  - faciliating programming compatible with the secure OSI architecture,
    it is simply intuitive in this system,

  - enforcing control of code execution correctness by raising exceptions,

  - full access control to any resources (HAC), the above mentioned new
    philosophy of privileges, a new approach to linking privileges
    with the pricess and a new process model, etc...

  - destabilisation of the native filesystem is practically impossible,

  - redundance and request distribution support

- functionality and simplicity:

  - the system is universal by providing commode modules and centralized
    control as well as an effective virtual processor architecture with
    limited but efficient command set

  - the possibility of creating distributed systems without having to modify
    the code; the possibility of request propagation without any need to
    modify the code (of an application)

  - exceptions make exception handling easier

  - introducing even serious system changes may happen on the fly by
    module exchange

- efficiency:

   - load balancing, creating clusters, distributing the solution among
     machines can be done without modifying the source code of its
     elements

  - by using a low level virtual code, instead of -- as in the case of Java
    -- a high level code, efficiency reduction is not so striking, nor does
    it limit the abilities of the code. Loops of the "idle" kind (i.e. a
    repeated jump) is a few times slower than in a compiled C program running
    on a given hardware platform, which is a very good result. In case of
    more complicated operations (e.g. I/O), efficiency reduction is much lower,
    oscillating around 15-30%,

  - the kind of multitasking implemented is far more stable and much more
    memory-saving than on the native system; it results in part from
    the fact that a virtual Argante processor needs less information to
    maintain a process than Unix does, and also from imperfection of many
    systems.

We wanted to combine QNX, HURD and all our "loose" ideas to create a
really secure and effective solution :) Later, Pawel Krawczyk pointed out
that Inferno embeded system, developed by Lucent, contains several solutions
quite similar to Argante. Of course, there are also major differences (Argante
is all-purpose environment for secure applications that doesn't enforce any
high-level solutions and focus on the low-level security).

We believe we avoided such strange half-solutions - like moving high-level
functionality to low-level layer with no good reason (and thus decreasing
freedom of design and making overgrown code); we decided for such step only
in specific, well-documented and explained cases, where we're sure it will
offer some real good for the programmer without enforcing static, complex
solutions where they are not necessary.

Details on Inferno can be found at:
http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/bltj.html.

And another thing: you can view a simple but joyful tutorial starting three
programs by typing "./build test".

What's still unfinished in Argante? I believe some new modules should be
developed to give Argante the access to appliances where it could be usable.
While making AOSr1, we focused on the things that are absolutely necessary
to make it interesting and innovative, but also, we had to delay some
developments (mainly because we do not have enough people). Here's our
list of things to be done in AOSr2:

- for making AOS multi-purpose platform for client applications as well,
  'screen'-based virtual process consoles and full console I/O support
  will be introduced,

- also, for visualization purposes, Argante will have X Window connectivity
  mid-end modules to allow graphical output and operations; these modules
  are not really inventive ;), but could make Argante something more than
  server / cluster platform,

- easier usage: graphical GUI for X Window system: session / console
  management,

- and, what's probably the most important, AHLL language translator will
  be almost completely rewritten to fit our expectations.

We are seriously considering separating the bytecode interpreter from
I/O / debugging functionality in future releases of Argante. What do we mean?
Well, our bytecode interpreter, which is actually pretty easy to implement,
will be ported to several platforms:

- "software solution" it is right now - where time has to be shared between
  real system, I/O operations and currently executed code,

- cheap microcontrollers (eg. Motorola 68376) on the PCI/ISA cards - in
  this case, bytecode interpreter is stored in EEPROM, and controller is
  executing it, calling Argante I/O modules (running in real system) only
  if there's such need (on syscalls); controller will have it's own
  memory, and all transfers will be done using DMA. This will really
  speed-up whole solution, decrease the usage of real system, and made
  it even more secure - RSIS code won't be executed by main processor.
  Also, it will become fault-tolerant - even if real system crashes,
  VCPUs might survive, waiting for real system to resume I/O services :)
  We're going to design such RSIS-interpreter card in near future, as it
  isn't really complicated or expensive (M68376 costs $25).

- cheap external "processors" (eg. spare i386 box); in this case, bytecode
  interpreter will be launched at the boot time, with no OS layer; the problem
  is to provide fast enough half-duplex link with almost no latency between
  two boxes with no additional, expensive hardware; dedicated ethernet
  _might_ be the answer,

- one day, maybe dedicated RSIS hardware solutions - eg. chips implementing
  RSIS functionality as a native language?:) Well, the last option is
  S-F for now ;)

What are the consequences? Well, one I/O mid-end might connect several
solutions - software boxes, dedicated hardware, and so on - providing unified
input and output for the project, with no risk one box might affect work
of other boxes. Also, even if mid-end crashes, properly written AOS
software will survive it and resume it's work after rebooting the mid-end.

Ok - we sure this list isn't closed - and so, your comments, ideas and
suggestions will be more than welcome :)
