This is Bulba's Distributed Virtual Router (early beta)
-------------------------------------------------------

For now, it works on Linux only.

How to use it?

0. Edit conf/ files (you can simply rename the example files, but it's
   generally better to revise the config); build Argante binaries, then
   launch it.

1. Connect a few instances of Argante using ripcd. This should be
   described somewhere in README. Alternatively, you can perform
   local tests, as well, but you have to provide separate configurations
   for each DVR instance.

2. Go to work/ and 'make' the project, then load output .img file
   into Argante sessions on connected boxes or on one box on separate
   VCPUs or argante instances.

3. Disable packet forwarding on test boxes. Assuming you have the following
   configuration:

   net1         RT1                           RT2          net2
   ---------- [ DVR ] ------ (ripcd) ------ [ DVR ] -----------
   10.1.0.0/16           i n t e r n e t           10.2.0.0./16

   You have to choose one box in net1 and one box in net2, then
   set route to 10.2.0.0/16 from net1 via RT1 and from net2 to
   10.1.0.0/16 via RT2. Remember to have packet forwarding disabled on
   these boxes!

4. Boom. It should work. You can add other locations, build redundant
   links using ripcd, and so on.


Sample configuration can be found at Examples/DVR1 and Examples/DVR2 (two
complementary routers with basic configuration).
