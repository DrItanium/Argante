eth0 10.1.2.3/16

I'M LAZY SO ONLY FIRST LINE IS ANALYSED
CONTENT EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:
<iff name>space<iff ip addr>/<netmask len>

after modification rename it to 'dvr.conf'

"Bulba's Config for Dummies part I"
if you have interface eth0 with address 64.2.10.33
and netmask 255.255.255.240
your line should look like:
eth0 64.2.10.33/28

if you don't get it yet go buy yourself new sony playstation 2 
and be all you can be... but be it somewhere else...
