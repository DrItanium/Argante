This is tiny HTTP server implementation for demonstration purposes only :)
It's really simple, but have basic functionality - can serve static webpages,
graphics and binary files. No scripts, no authorization, no virtual hosts, 
no numerous other capabilities - written in several hours :>

What's probably interesting, this really effective, non-forking code
has been done in approx. 200 lines of ellegant code, with no need to care
about ../.. bugs, overflows and other things.

It's small, fast and secure. It doesn't show even 5% of Argante capabilities
- we're going to write good HTTP server with cluster architecture etc, but
it's impossible before Bulba will finish rIPC :)))

NOTE: it does not support async send() for now. But hey - here are
ApacheBench results for 10 transfers of 4.5 MB libc.so GET :)

Argante:
Requests per second:    10.48
Transfer rate:          43169.52 kb/s received

Apache:
Requests per second:    8.94
Transfer rate:          36805.81 kb/s received

:) In another test, 1000 transfers of small file, Apache beats us (it's
about 20-40% faster), but it's pretty good results as we don't have
async file transfers yet :)

So enjoy - edit custom.ahh, choose your favourite port and go ahead, you'll
see small demo in default configuration :)

You can build it using './BUILD' command. Generated .img file can be used 
safely :>
