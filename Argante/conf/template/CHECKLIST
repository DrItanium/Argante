Argante Operating System - new project checklist:
-------------------------------------------------

How to build a project:

0. Read the documentation. Do it. Without it, you won't be able to
   do anything.

1. Edit conf/scripts/argboot.scr to load all the modules you want 
   to use in the project and to add any other functionality you'd like
   to have.

2. Edit conf/ files according to the guidelines you can find in the
   documentation to set up access control, filesystem etc.

3. Create your code in work/ directory. Use acc to compile AHLL files
   and agtc to compile RSIS assembly files.

4. Run ./argante and check your settings.
