We've decided to release Argante 1.0 not because we're sure it is bug-free,
perfectly stable and has all necessary features. We're doing it to
stimulate futher development, receive useful criticism, suggestions and
concepts.

Due to static code segment and no ability to execute external code, Argante
is very resistant to bugs. The only kind of bugs that can be exploited are
serious DoS or validation error conditions in syscalls invoked from
specific code with user-dependent parameters. These problems can be
qualified as security / stability bugs. Other problems have no direct
impact for existing code, but, of course, are worth fixing.

In both cases, we strongly suggest to report bugreports to <argante@cgs.pl>
directly. You might, of course, report your findings to full-disclosure
lists like BUGTRAQ, but - in such case - please contact us first.

KNOWN BUGS IN AOSr1:

[0001] console lockup [type: other] [severity: marginal]

  svgalib and libreadline don't mix; if console is launched on terminal
  directly (without agtses/agtback) and is compiled with libreadline
  support, after using graphic apps, you might notice libreadline lockup or 
  no ability to read user input in graphics mode.

[0002] math.so bugs [type: other] [severity: medium]

  this isn't specific bug, but math module seems to have numerous
  problems and is extremely ineffective; it should be partially rewritten,
  please do not use it if not necessary.

[0003] AHLL bugs [type: validation errors] [severity: medium]

  AHLL compiler doesn't check for parameter types and has numerous other
  problems with code parsing; it will be completely rewritten soon - if
  you encounter any strange problems, feel free to contact us.

[0004] ripcd bugs [type: other] [severity: medium]

  rIPC is a huge piece of C code; it has been finished just a few hours
  before AOSr1 release and should be intensively tested and debugged.

  A lot of compilation-time warnings are present :P

[0005] portability problems [type: other] [severity: medium]

  packet.c is completely Linux-dependent
  ipc.c *might* behave strangely on some boxes (reports are welcome!)
  ripcd daemon won't compile on Solaris
  locallib.c is Linux-dependent

  We are aware of these problems. All fixes and suggestions are welcome.
