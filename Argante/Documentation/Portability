AOSr1 currently works on following platforms:
---------------------------------------------

- Linux:

  Will run on 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4 kernels. With recent glibc version, 
  libreadline and termcap support will be compiled in the console code.
  Additionally, on this platform, svgalib connectivity module is
  available (modules/gfx.so).

- FreeBSD:

  Will run. Low-level network support is not available (packet.c) - it needs
  porting; unfortunately, bikappa doesn't like libpcap-alikes :/ Unconfirmed
  rumours are saying libreadline can be used safely on this platform as
  well, but we're afraid due to ugly Linux-specific clone() hack, which
  should be re-coded in portable way before AOSr2.

- NetBSD:

  Will run. Low-level network support is not available (packet.c) - see 
  FreeBSD.

- OpenBSD:

  Will run. Low-level network support is not available (packet.c) - see 
  FreeBSD. If there are unresolved symbols in library, Argante might terminate
  after displaying "unresolved symbol" linker error. This bug is related to
  OpenBSD dynamic linker semantics and will be fixed one day.

- SunOS/Solaris:

  Will run. Requires GNU make, GNU awk, GNU cc and GNU ld in the path
  before default Solaris versions of these programs (this applies to
  linker especially - please modify your PATH before calling ./build and
  make sure "ld --version" returns "GNU ld 2.9.1" or so. Default Solaris
  linker is odd and is not supported for now. Also, low-level network
  support is not available yet - see FreeBSD notes.

- IRIX64:

  Will run. Requires GNU make and GNU cc. Low-level network support is not
  available yet - see FreeBSD notes.

- Other platforms?

  Not supported yet. If you have access to interesting boxes - especially
  AIX, HP/UX and so on - please tell us! We'll do our best to provide
  working port.
