  In some cases, it is important to invoke Argante programs via unix
  command-line, from servlets, as a CGI scripts or from SSI. In this case,
  you can use tools/agtexe utility.

  This program is able to connect to running, background AOS session,
  load given program, catch any errors (returning apropriate error message
  or return code). It will continue running until program will be terminated
  (if it happened due to exception, it might display message or return
  specific code), eventually arranging I/O session between process and its
  console. Argante VCPU will be automatically terminated if any signal will be
  caught by agtexe.

  Usage:

    agtexe program_name f[cwm] pid
          |              |||  |
          |              |||  +------- AOS session pid
          |              |||
          |              ||+---------- do not display messages on errors
          |              |+----------- do not wait for process to terminate
          |              +------------ do not arrange I/O session
          |
          +---- you have to use absolute path! all relative paths are
                relative to AOS cwd, not agtexe CWD!


  Examples:

    (execute work/test.img, default settings, find Argante)
    agtexec $PWD/work/test.img f `ps x|grep ':.. argante'|grep -v grep|cut -b-6|head -1`

    (execute /test/test.img, without console, be silent, given pid)
    agtexec /test/test.img fcm 12345

  Exit codes:

    0 - successful execution (process terminated by HALT or 'w' option)
    1 - agtexe caught signal, process terminated
    2 - execution failure (bad binary image)
    3 - unhandled exception during execution
    4 - couldn't attach to Argante session
