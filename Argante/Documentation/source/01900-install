  Specific installation is not required. First of all, copy argante,
  tools/agtses and tools/agtback to your PATH - eg. to /usr/local/bin.
  You can also put modules/*.so in eg /usr/lib/argante, if you want.
  This can be done automatically using './build install'.

  To set up basic project worskspace, you can use "agtproj" utility.

  To launch the system in background, with no interactive console, use:

  agtback argante SCRIPTNAME ROOTDIR

  You could always access console of such session using agtses command. To run
  foreground session (debugging purposes, for example), you could use:

  argante SCRIPTNAME ROOTDIR

  SCRIPTNAME - absolute path to boot script

  ROOTDIR - project root directory (argante working directory)

  For details on project root directory, see below sections.
