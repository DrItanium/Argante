  NOTE: Yes, there are no precautions for launching several instances of
  Argante on one physical system, with completely different projects. One
  of its purposes might be testing of distributed/cluster solutions. But
  you should respect one rule - only one VS instance should be able to write
  specific real system resource. For example, if you're deciding to put
  FooBar file, physically located in /TestMe directory, in SVFS space for
  two different argante instances on the same system at the same time, you
  should give write access only to VCPU(s) on one virtual machine ("file
  access manager(s)"), and arrange write-request passing using rIPC.

  The same applies to NFS shared resources - be careful. It's just there's no
  accurate and portable way to determine if file is locked for writing in
  real system by other instance, so file damage might occour.
