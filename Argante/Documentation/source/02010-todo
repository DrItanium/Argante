  + Endian block translation (in advmem). Assigned person: lcamtuf
    Status: DONE

  + Solaris/BSD portability for low-level networking (packet.c); well, in
    fact, someone should write #ifdef code for every platform when it comes
    to packet sniffing. BPF support would be nice. Assigned person: bikappa
    (as long as he will found some free time to write AND TEST his code on a
    few platforms ;)
    Status: CONCEPT

  + Solaris, BSD, IRIX: ripcd portability; some minor fixes are required to
    make it portable accross these platforms. Assigned person: (???)

  + AHLL should be rewritten using some flex/bison-alike stuff.
    Assigned person: Bulba or lcamtuf (???)

  + Math module should be optimized (floating point arrays -> fixed point or
    int arrays, etc). Assigned person: z33d
    Status: ALMOST DONE

  + Some examples - SMTP, POP3 functionality should be good.
    Assigned person: (???) - after AHLL rewriting!
