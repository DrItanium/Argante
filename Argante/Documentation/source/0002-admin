  Welcome, glad you stopped by. It's a perfect moment to introduce
  ourselves. We are a loose-knit group of computer security enthusiasts,
  hackers, programists, developers - to be short, people who really
  enjoy doing something challenging, and who cannot stand our computer
  world is, in fact, broken by design :-)
  
  Argante project has been founded in late September, 2000, by
  Michal Zalewski (lcamtuf), as a result of... well, just a bet =) But
  surprisingly, more and more people became interested in making really
  secure, free, effective and simple environment just to feel they are
  making something useful =) As for now, Argante Development Team consist
  of around 12 actively coding people, assisted slightly higher number of
  spectators. But, as our rule of thumb, we are listing active coders /
  contributors only - and here they are, in chronological order:
  
  * Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@ids.pl>
  
    That's me :) I am a project coordinator, also known as "pain in the 
    ass", mostly hated and against any progress =) I did most of the
    original project, microkernel and basic modules design, coded
    our tiny assembler, big and ugly AHLL translator (which has to
    be rewritten, anyway), made a lot of compliants regarding other
    people's work, and so on :)

  * Bulba (bulba@intelcom.pl)
  
    Bulba developed interprocess communication subsystem (noone really
    undestands how it works ;), and did some other valuable work - fixes,
    suggestions, utility proggies. Unfortunately, not very reliable when
    it comes to delivering the code promised earlier ;)
    
  * Maurycy Prodeus (z33d@eth-security.net)
  
    Author or real-time debugging and deassemby support; did some other
    enhancements, developed math and advmem module. Sentenced for ten
    years of prison for developing blinkenlights driver for Argante
    kernel.
  
  * Artur Skura (arturs@people.pl)
  
    This guy did enormous amount of work translating my not really clear
    ideas and thoughts to English. Did readline support on Linux console
    and some PR-related work =)
		      
  * Marcin Dawcewicz (miv@interia.pl)
  
    Developed high-level network support, did some testing; author of
    never really finished ripcd daemon. Killed in Action?
			
  * bikappa (bikappa@itapac.net)
  
    Low-level network connectivity module. Not much to say, good work,
    except he does not really like to test his code ;)
			  
  * Lukasz Jachowicz (honey@linuxnews.pl)
  
    (Depreciated) SVGAlib console support for amusement purposes; held
    in this section because of really lovely girlfriend ;)
    
  * ArtGabi (www.artgabi.com.pl)
  
    Guys who did our website and logo design completely for free :)
			      
  * Adam Podstawczyñski (adam@english.w3.pl)
  
    Documentation review and cleanup.
				
  * scrippie (ronald@grafix.nl)
  
    Documentation cleanups, numerous bugfixes and code cleanups :>
				  
  * Marcin Zukowski (eru@ibbrain.ibb.waw.pl)
  
    The Guy, Who Started Writing Modula-3 translator (and developed
    Midnight Commander syntax highlighting files). Valuable contributor,
    unfortunately never managed to finish his work :/
				    
  * Jaroslaw J. Pyszny (arghil@zeisk.tech.us.edu.pl)
  
    Known for valuable discussions and vim syntax highlight files :)
				      
  * Adam Chodorowski (adam.chodorowski@bigfoot.com)
  
    GGI display support and miscleanous suggestions :)
    
  * James Kehl (ecks@optusnet.com.au)

  * Mariusz Woloszyn (woloszyn@ipartners.pl)

  Thats it :-) Hope you are still reading... So, let's start our
  journey :)
