  These syscalls have corresponding AHLL library calls, so this knowledge
  isn't mandatory, but might explain some troubleshooting problems. Also,
  as there's no AHLL library calls documentation available at the moment,
  it might be helpful in understanding AHLL procedures.

  NOTE: every module using HAC may return, besides standard exceptions,
  values: ACL_PROBLEM, NOPERM.

  For rIPC API documentation, see separate chapter.
