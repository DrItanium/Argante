  SVFS hierarchy should be designed carefully. For example, putting vital
  system configuration files directly in SVFS is just stupid. If you have
  to modify local system, you should read details on real system interaction
  below, and create interface between your processes and real-system tools.

  Symlinks are allowed (and treated just like regular files, as long as
  they are not dangling ;), but should be used carefully. The same applies
  to hardlinks. Generally, you should design your project in the way that
  does not need any kind of links in SVFS.

  Below, you'll find some precautions for mapping NFS objects or objects
  shared between different AOS instances.
