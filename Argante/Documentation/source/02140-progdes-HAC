  Assign every type of operation performed in your project specific
  domain number. For example: 1 - user files access, 2 - network listening,
  3 - making data connections back to user, 4 - accessing password files,
  5 - communication with command parser, 6 - communication with user files
  module (sorry, only numeric domain names are supported for now). You
  cannot use numbers below 100.

  For every functional module, assign list of domains it have to access
  (using #compiler !domains a b c d...).

  Before any operation (syscall) accessing specific kind of resources /
  operations, set domain number respectively. Drop these privileges
  after finishing specific kind of operations.

  If you want to "act" as some user or subobject within specific domain, you
  can set domain UID as well. For example, before accessing files owned
  by user 1234, you can set your privileges to domain=1, domain_uid=1234.
  By using domain_uid, you'll be able to restrict access to specific
  resource within group.

  Then, when your HAC hierarchy is completed, and you can do list like:

  domain 2 should be able to bind to all IPs to port 21 EXCEPT specific IP
  domain 1 uid 1234 should be able to do anything within
  /fs/ftp_server/users/mark

  ...and so on, you can build conf/access.hac file. Please refer HAC
  documentation for specific modules. In above example, HAC access file should
  look this way:

  2:0     net/address/source/tcp/SPECIFIC_IP/21  net/sock/listen   deny
  2:0     net/address/source/tcp/all/21          net/sock/listen   allow
  1:1234  fs/ftp_server/users/mark               fs                allow
  [...]
