  This section is unfinished as for AOSr1 - please take a look at Examples/AHLL
  directory for guidelines on designing .ahh files and .ahl code.

  Except the limitations I have described before, there are some language
  bugs we have no time to solve in this release:

  - parameterless functions are not working,

  - you have to finish all structural / array initializers with ',',

  - /* */ comments when #defining something _might_ be harmful,

  - generally, lack of separators _might_ be harmful, so write x := 1 rather
    than x:=1.

  Please take a look on Examples/AHLL - you will find numerous small AHLL
  examples there:

    dir.ahl    - this cute program will dump the listing of SVFS directory
                contents.

    gfx.ahl    - simple but juicy example of SVGAlib connectivity (on Linux,
                requires modules/gfx.so to be loaded)

    hello.ahl  - "nn green bottles standing on the wall"...

    ptrs.ahl   - some pointer manipulation examples

    http/      - sources for Mini-HTTP server.

  I guess both http/httpd.ahl and, let's say, gfx.ahl, are pretty good
  examples of AHLL style. Programs are perfectly readable and self-commenting.
