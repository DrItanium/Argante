Official TODO list for Argante 2.0:
-----------------------------------

This list is open, no single line of code was written, assignments are
subject to futher agreements :> Feel free to comment this list, tell me if
you are interested in specific subject:

1) Endian block translation (in advmem). Assigned person: lcamtuf
   Status: DONE

2) Solaris/BSD portability for low-level networking (packet.c); well, in
   fact, someone should write #ifdef code for every platform when it
   comes to packet sniffing. BPF support would be nice. Assigned
   person: bikappa (as long as he will found some free time to write AND
   TEST his code on a few platforms ;)
   Status: CONCEPT

3) Solaris, BSD, IRIX: ripcd portability; some minor fixes are required
   to make it portable accross these platforms. Assigned person: (???)
   Status: CONCEPT

4) Mainstream Argante: HP/UX, AIX ports. Assigned person: (???)
   Status: PARTIALLY DONE

5) Bytecode interpreter JITs (jumps in table) instead of multiple ifs.
   Mariusz Woloszyn.
   Status: NEEDS REFINING

6) X Window: GTK-based GUI (agtses, agtback functionality; basic
   console commands as menu items / buttons; vcpucons / agtexe
   in xterm window). Assigned person: (???)
   Status: UNDER DEVELOPMENT

7) AHLL should be rewritten using some flex/bison-alike stuff.
   Assigned person: Bulba or lcamtuf (???)
   Status: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...

9) Math module should be optimized (floating point arrays -> fixed
   point or int arrays, etc). Assigned person: z33d
   Status: ALMOST DONE

10) Some examples - SMTP, POP3 functionality should be good.
    Assigned person: (???) - after AHLL rewriting!
    Status: CONCEPT

11) PDF/sgml/html documentation, completely revised and clean.
    Assigned person: lcamtuf
    Status: CONCEPT
