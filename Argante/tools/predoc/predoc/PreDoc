Starting from release 1.1, Argante documentation is generated automatically
using 'predoc' utility. Predoc can be found in Documentation/ directory. It
parses Documentation/predoc files, which are supposed to be in the following
format:

 00x00-name     - ASCII text file with single documentation chapter. 'x'
                  should be changed to reflect chapter order in compiled
		  documentation
		  
 00x00-name.tag - tagfile, format described below
 
Only chapters with tagfile present are parsed. Automated index, table of
contents and chapter numbering is done by predoc utility. Tagfile format:

@ATAG1@
I: devel
I: first
K: naked chicks
K: mere mortals
S: obsolete
T: How to use a computer
A: Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@dione.ids.pl>
M: Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@dione.ids.pl>
V: 1.0
D: 10/11/2000
@END@

  (...everything not matching this format is skipped - put comments etc...)

Lines starting with 'I: ' are describing documentation profiles in which
this chapter should be included. You can specify as many profiles as you want.
Currently available set of profiles:

  first		- README.first, a quick guide to Argante
  concept	- README.concept, Advocacy.txt replacement
  devel  	- README.devel, developer's guide

'K: ' lines should contain important keywords or keyphrases that should be 
indexed. 
  
'S: ' line describes status. Allowed status:

  release	- no changes necessary, final version
  draft		- rough draft
  outdated	- outdated, needs to be updated / rewritten

'T: ' line describes chapter title.

'A: ' line describes author (preferably with e-mail). 'M: ' line describes
