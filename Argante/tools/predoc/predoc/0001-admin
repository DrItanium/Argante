  Welcome to Argante System Management guide. This document is provided
  to familiarize you with Argante system structure, give useful hints
  and advices on setting up and administrating projects, a brief
  information on real-system interaction, etc. 
  
  If you are not really familiar with Argante basics, we strongly suggest
  you to read "Quick Introduction" (README.first) document. If you are
  interested in Argante Project development or in programming in this
  virtual environment, you should focus on our "Developer's Guide"
  (README.devel) and "System Developer's Guide" (README.sysprog) as well.
  
  Thank you for choosing Argante :-)
  
  Virtually Yours,
  Argante Development Team
