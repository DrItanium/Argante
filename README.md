This is a conversion of the Argante Virtual Operating System cvs source code repo
found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/argante/.

It is very old but I find it very fascinating for my i960 based machine.


see https://argante.sourceforge.net/concept.html for more information

The A2 folder has a broken build in it, I will inspect that at some time in the
future. But for now, my focus is on Argante
